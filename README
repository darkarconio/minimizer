A program that calculates the minimum energy structure of a classical harmonic lattice.
Elastic properties can be calculated through deformations of the cell dimensions (no UI yet)

Requirements:
GSL must be installed

Installation:
make

Input:
An xsf file with the structure info

Running the Program:
./minimization [input file] [equilibrium bond length] [multiplication factor for the input cell]
